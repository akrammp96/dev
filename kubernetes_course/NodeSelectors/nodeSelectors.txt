___Node Selectors____


You have a three-node cluster of which two are smaller nodes

with lower hardware resources, and one of them

is a larger node configured with higher resources.

You have different kinds of workloads

running in your cluster.

You would like to dedicate the data processing workloads

that require higher horsepower to the larger node




___What should you do____

To solve this, we can set a limitation on the pods

so that they only run on particular nodes.

There are two ways to do this.

The first is using nodeSelectors

which is the simple and easier method.

For this, we look at the pod definition file

we created earlier.

This file has a simple definition to create a pod

with a data processing image.

To limit this pod to run on the larger node,

we add a new property called nodeSelector

to the spec section and specify the size as large.


_____How to use labels selectors_____
To use labels in a nodeSelector like this,

you must have first labeled your nodes

prior to creating this pod.
