The difference between G and GI:
G is gigabyte and it refers to a thousand megabytes, whereas GI refers to gibibyte and refers to 1024 mebibyte.
The same applies to megabyte and kilobyte.

You can set a limit for the resource usage on these Pods by adding a limit section
under the resources section in your Pod definition file. Specify new limits for the memory and CPU like this.
When the Pod is created, Kubernetes sets new limits for the container. 
Remember that the limits and requests are set for each container within the Pod.


Hint: 

In case of CPU, Kubernetes throttles the CPU

so that it does not go beyond the specified limit.

A container cannot use more CPU resources than its limit.

However, this is not the case with the memory.

A container can use more memory resources than its limit.

So if a Pod tries to consume more memory

than its limit constantly,

the Pod will be terminated.



For the POD to pick up defaults you must have first set those as default values for request and limit by creating a LimitRange in that namespace.


Create the LimitRange in the default-mem-example namespace:
kubectl apply -f memory-defaults.yaml --namespace=default-mem-example


Difference between default and defaultRequest: 
default means that the container can never consume more than the memory amount or CPU amount indicated.
defaultRequest are the minimum guaranteed amount of a resource that is reserved for a container.
