There are different patterns
of multi-container pods in Kubernetes,

such as 
-the ambassador 
-the adapter 
-the sidecar.

the microservices architecture can help scale up, down,
as well as modify each service as required 
as opposed to modifying the entire application.

 at times you may need

two services to work together,

such as a web server and a logging service.
