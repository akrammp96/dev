____how to get containers logs_____
In this case, I modify my pod definition file

to include an additional container called image processor.

If you run the Kube control logs command now

with the pod name, which container's logs would it show?

To get a specific container logs:

kubectl logs -f <pod_name> <container_name>
kubectl logs -f event-simulator-pod event-simulator
