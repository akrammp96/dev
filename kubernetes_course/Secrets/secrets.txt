_____What are secrets ?____

The ConfigMap stores configuration data
in plain text format.
So while it would be okay to move the hostname and username
into a ConfigMap,

it is definitely not the right place to store a password.
This is where Secrets come in.


___Create a secret___

__________Imperative
kubectl create secret generic app-secret --from-literal=DB_Host=mysql
                                        --from-literal=DB_Pass=123

or from file =====> check the configMap.

__________Declarative

with a yaml file

___Inject into a pod___


EnvFrom:
  - secretRef:
       name: app-config

single Env:

env:

- name: DB_Password

    valueFrom:

      secretKeyRef:

        name: app-secret

        key: DB_Password
