Kubernetes services enable communication between various components within
and outside of the application. Kubernetes services helps us connect applications together with other applications or users.


-NodePort-

The Kubernetes service is an object just

like pods, ReplicaSet, or deployments

that we worked with before.

One of its use case is to listen

to a port on the node and forward request on that port

to a port on the pod running the web application.

This type of service is known

as a NodePort service because the service listens

to a port on the node and forward request to the pods.



-ClusterIp-

The second is ClusterIP, and in this case

the service creates a virtual IP

inside the cluster to enable communication

between different services, such as a set

of front-end servers to a set of back-end servers.



The pods all have an IP address assigned to them

as we can see on the screen.

But these IPs, as we know, are not static.

These pods can go down any time

and new pods are created all the time,

and so you cannot rely on these IP addresses



--------------------LoadBalancer- 
A good example of that would be to distribute load

across the different web servers in your front-end tier.
