___Key definition about docker containers__

containers are not meant to host an operating system.

Containers are meant to run a specific task or process,

such as to host an instance of a web server,
or application server or a database,
or simply to carry out some kind of computation or analysis.

____why  ubuntu doesnt run as a docker container____

Docker created a container from the Ubuntu image, and launched the BASH program.

By default, Docker does not attach a terminal
to a container when it is run,
and so the Bash program does not find a terminal,
and so it exits.

docker run ubuntu [command] 
docker run ubuntu sleep 5

    OR

We could use the docker image


___Difference CMD and ENTRYPOINT____

 we shouldn't have to specify the sleep command again.

Instead, we would like it to be something like this.

Docker run Ubuntu Sleeper 10.

We only want to pass in the number

of seconds the container should sleep,

and sleep command should be invoked automatically,

and that is where the entry point instruction comes

into play.

ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
CMD ["5"]

--- > docker run ubuntu-sleeper 10


______The other difference ???_____
CMD ["sleep", "5"]
docker run ubuntu-sleeper sleep 10 
---> This will overides the CMD command. 
but if we choose to put ENTRYPOINT then we'll force sleep 5
and docke run ubuntu-sleeper sleep 10 wont change the actual
command.
