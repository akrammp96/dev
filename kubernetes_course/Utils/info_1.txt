When an external request reaches a Kubernetes cluster, the following steps occur:


1- The request first reaches the networking layer of the cluster, which can be an Ingress controller or a load balancer.

2- The networking layer, which is responsible for routing and load balancing, examines the request's headers, including the requested host and path.

3- Based on the request's host and path, the networking layer forwards the request to the appropriate backend service.

4- The kubelet, running on the node where the backend service resides, receives the request.

5- The kubelet then identifies the pod associated with the backend service based on the Service and Endpoint objects defined in Kubernetes.

6- Once the pod is identified, the kubelet forwards the request to the corresponding container within the pod.
