_______how to do monitoring in kubernetes?______ 

 the number of nodes in the cluster,

how many of them are healthy,

as well as performance metrics,

such as CPU, memory, network and disc utilization;

as well as pod level metrics,

such as the number of pods

and the performance metrics of each pod,

such as the CPU and memory consumption on them.


_____________________________________________
we need a solution that will monitor these metrics,
store them, and provide analytics around this data


Kubernetes does not come 
with a full featured built-in monitoring solution.

_____________The metrics server ? ______________

The Metrics Server retrieves metrics
from each of the Kubernetes nodes and pods,
aggregates them and stores them in memory.

Kubernetes runs an agent on each node, known as the Kubelet,
which is responsible for receiving instructions
from the Kubernetes API master server.


_______________________________________________
The Kubelet also contains a sub component
known as the cAdvisor or Container Advisor.
cAdvisor is responsible for retrieving
performance metrics from pods
and exposing them through the Kubelet API


kubectl top node
kubectl top pod
