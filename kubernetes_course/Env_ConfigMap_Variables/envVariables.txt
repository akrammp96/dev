___How to set an env variable____

To set an environment variable,

use the env property.

Env is an array.

So every item under the env property starts with a dash,

indicating an item in the array.

Each item has a name and a value property.

env:
 - name: APP_COLOR
   value: blue
 - name: APP_PORT
   value: 8002
