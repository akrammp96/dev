_________WHY labels, selectors and annotations ?_________

___Labels are properties attached to each item.

So you add properties to each item for their class, kind and color.

___Selectors help you filter these items.

For example, when you say class equals mammal, we get a list

of mammals

_______In kubernetes_____

In a pod definition file, under Metadata,

create a section called Labels.

Under that, add the labels in a key value format like this.

You can add as many labels as you like.

Once the pod is created, to select the pod with the labels,

use the cube control; get pods command,

along with the selector option,

and specify the condition like app equals app one.



____NOTE !!!!

In a replica set definition file,

you will see labels defined in two places.

Note that this is an area where beginners tend

to make a mistake.

The labels defined under the template section

are the labels configured on the pods.

The labels you see at the top are the labels

of the replica set itself.



kubectl get pods --selector app=App1
